# 2018 Cloud Study Jams

The 2018 Cloud Study Jams kicked off on January. Learn more about the [Cloud Study Jams Agenda](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bZ6hEn3yVmXfyATn2RKmxKGjQe7OxitnIt0WIvcRdrs/edit#slide=id.g22fa4b5540_0_246). Then check the [QwikLabs Catalog](https://qwiklabs.com/catalog) to see all available training content. There are two main tracks: 

 * **Google Cloud** / 11 Quests / 106 Labs
 * **Amazon Web Services** / 22 Quests / 95 Labs

We will prioritize learning the _Google Cloud_ track.

#### 1. ```Learning Goals```

The broad goals are to learn:

 * how to setup development environments in Google Cloud
 * how to setup production environments in Google Cloud
 * how Docker & Kubernetes work
 * how to process Big Data in the Cloud

#### 2. ```In-Venue Study (3 hours)``` 

These are the minimum labs that you should have completed during the in-venue study jams session.

 - **GCP Essentials** / [Creating a Virtual Machine](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/6473)
 - **GCP Essentials** / [Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/6474)
 - **GCP Essentials** / [Provision Services with Cloud Launcher](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/6477)
 - **Kubernetes in the Google Cloud** / [Introduction to Docker](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/7042)
 - **Scientific Data Processing** / [Rent-a-VM to process Earthquake Data](https://qwiklabs.com/focuses/6897)

#### 3. ```At Home Study (1 month)``` 

Once those are completed (with the custom link provided) you should unlock 1 free month of QwikLabs access. At this point, you can follow your own path through the courses. Here is one recommended path. 

 * Intermediate / [GCP Essentials Quest](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/23) / 5h / 7-labs / _23-credits_
 * Beginner / [Baseline: Infrastructure](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/33) / 6h / 10-labs / _10-credits_
 * Beginner / [Deploying Applications](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/26) / 8h / 9-labs / _57-credits_
 * Advanced / [Machine Learning APIs](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/32) / 6h / 7-labs / _57-credits_
 * Advanced / [Kubernetes in the Google Cloud](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/29) / 8h / 8-labs / _54-credits_
 * Advanced / [Scientific Data Processing](https://qwiklabs.com/quests/28)  / 6h / 7-labs / _44-credits_

Finishing the GCP Essentials quest _may_ unlock an additional month on the subscription, so prioritize that first. After that, prioritize quests that require higher credit counts so you can maximize the usage of that free subscription (which effectively covers those credits).
